## Description
Noted is a react-app that allows the user to create lists and notes. Create, label, edit and delete as many lists or cards as necessary, whether it be for reminders, to-do lists or whatever else you may need. Lists and cards can be prioritized by highlighted their 'watch' or 'star' symbol, respectively.

## Motivation
I created Noted as a challenge to display my skills working through CRUD operations and manipulating data and local storage. I was inspired by an app, Trello, that I frequently use and find quite helpful for working on prejects such as these.
